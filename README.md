# Mega World Prototype (PlayCanvas)

A minimal PlayCanvas-based prototype that streams simple terrain chunks so you can walk continuously across a procedural world. Click the canvas to lock the mouse, then use **WASD + mouse look** to move; hold **Shift** to sprint.

## Running locally
Open `index.html` in a modern browser (or serve the folder with any static server) to try the prototype.
