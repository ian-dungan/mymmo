# Freeport Landing (PlayCanvas)

A single-zone prototype inspired by EverQuest's Freeport harbor. Walk the docks, city walls, and plaza to test controls and scale.
Click the canvas to lock the mouse, then use **WASD + mouse look** to move; hold **Shift** to sprint.

## Running locally
Open `index.html` in a modern browser (or serve the folder with any static server) to try the prototype.
